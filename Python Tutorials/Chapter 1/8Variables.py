# number1 = 4
# print(number1)
# number2 = 6
# print(number2)
# # So in Python we do not need to mention the data types as we used to mention in java and C. This gives us flexibility.
# name = "Himanish"
# print(name)
# name = 123
# print(name)
# Python is a dynamically typed language. It doesnâ€™t know about the type of the variable until the code is run. So declaration is of no use. What it does is, It stores that value at some memory location and then binds that variable name to that memory container. And makes the contents of the container accessible through that variable name. So the data type does not matter. As it will get to know the type of the value at run-time.

# Rules of naming variable
# Rule1--> Variables should not begin with number
# 1number=4 --> Wrong Syntax
# num2ber=6 --> But you can use number in between

# Rule 2--> You cannot use $ or these types of special characters not even in the start or in between
# $num2=5
# num$2=9

# Rule 3--> You can start your variable name with an underscore or even use it in between
# _num1=6
# num_1=9

# Naming Conventions
user_one_name = "Himanish" # Snake Case Writing --> Python follows this
userOneName = "Harshit" # Camel Case Writing --> Languages like java follows this
