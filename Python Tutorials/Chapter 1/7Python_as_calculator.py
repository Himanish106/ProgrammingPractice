# print(2+3*4-8)
# print(2/4)  # --> This is known as Floating point division
# print(4/2)  # --> This is known as Floating point division
# print(2//4)  # --> This is known as Integer division
# print(4//2)  # --> This is known as Integer division
# print(2**3)  # --> This is known as exponential
# print(2**0.5)  # But here we see we are getting a very big value. So in order to get small value we use round function
# print(round(2**0.5, 4))  # Here 4 denotes the no. of spaces
print(2**3/2*6-4*(3-4/2))
# 2**3/2*6-4*(3-2)
# 2**3/2*6-4*1
# 2**3/2*6-4*1
# 8/2*6-4*1 (8/2*6 ---> Here we are using the concept of left to right associativity)
# 4*6-4*1
# 24-4*1
# 24-4
# 20 --> Final Answer
print(2**3**2) #--> This follows left to right associativity
#  2**9
# 512 --> This is our final result
