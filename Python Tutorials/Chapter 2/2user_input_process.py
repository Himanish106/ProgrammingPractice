# For user input we use input() function
name = input("Type your name\n")
print("Hello " + name)
age = input("What is your age?\n") # By default it deals the variable as a string
print("Your age is "+age)
# In our previous code where we learnt about String Concatenation we learnt that we can only concatenate 2 strings using "+" sign. But not a number. So here age being a number it is treated as a string . 20-->"20"
