# Write a Python program to count the number of occurrences of a specific element in a list.

# Your program should take the list and the element as inputs and output the number of occurrences. You can assume that the list and the element are both of the same data type.

list1=[2,5,7,2,4,3,3,2,8,2]
print(list1.count(2))
