# Write a program that takes a list of words as input from the user. The program should create a dictionary where the keys are the words in the list and the values are the lengths of the corresponding words. The program should then print the dictionary.

# For example, if the input list is: ['apple', 'banana', 'orange', 'kiwi'], the program should output:

# arduino
# Copy code
# {
#   'apple': 5,
#   'banana': 6,
#   'orange': 6,
#   'kiwi': 4
# }
# Please provide your solution in Python code.
