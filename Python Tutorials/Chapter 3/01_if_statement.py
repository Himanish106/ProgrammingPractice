# Remember the syntax. Notice there is an indentation before the print statement. This ia compulsory else we would get an indentation error. Like in C or java which we had learnt previously we used curly braces to put the statements inside the if block but here we need colon. In C or java we do need to use curly braces only for single line statements. But we had to use those braces compulsorily for more than one statements. But there is no such constraints here. We can use as many statements as we want or as per requirement
