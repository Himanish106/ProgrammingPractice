    What is a Thread in Java?
    A thread in Java is the direction or path that is taken while a program is being executed. Generally, 
    all the programs have at least one thread, known as the main thread, that is provided by the JVM or
    Java Virtual Machine at the starting of the program's execution. It is a lightweight subprocess also 
    known as processing.
    
    Multithreading is a process of executing multiple threads simultaneously.
