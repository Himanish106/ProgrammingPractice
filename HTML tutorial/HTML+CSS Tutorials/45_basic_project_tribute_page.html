          Bose is known for his strong nationalist beliefs and his unwavering
          commitment to achieving freedom for India.
        </li>
        <br />
        <br />
        <li>
          He played a crucial role in establishing and leading the Forward Bloc,
          a political organization that advocated for a united and independent
          India.
        </li>
        <br />
        <br />
        <li>
          Bose was elected as the President of the Indian National Congress in
          1938, where he emphasized the importance of complete independence from
          British rule.
        </li>
        <br />
        <br />
        <li>
          Dissatisfied with the nonviolent approach of Mahatma Gandhi and the
          Congress, Bose sought assistance from fascist regimes in Germany and
          Japan during World War II to gain support for India's independence.
        </li>
        <br />
        <br />
        <li>
          Bose formed the Indian National Army (INA) in 1942, comprised of
          Indian prisoners of war and civilians captured by the Japanese army.
          The INA fought alongside the Japanese against the British forces in
          Burma (now Myanmar).
        </li>
        <br />
        <br />
        <li>
          His famous slogan "Give me blood, and I shall give you freedom!"
          inspired many Indians to join the struggle for independence.
        </li>
        <br />
        <br />
        <li>
          Bose's mysterious death in a plane crash in 1945 in Taiwan (then
          Formosa) continues to be a subject of debate and controversy, with
          conspiracy theories surrounding his demise.
        </li>
        <br />
        <br />
        <li>
          His contribution to the independence movement, leadership qualities,
          and unwavering determination have made him an iconic figure in India's
          history.
