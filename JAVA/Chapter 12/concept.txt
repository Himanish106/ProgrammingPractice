Command to compile all programs and create all packages using a single Command
--> javac -d . *.javac
This . operator is very important because it means to put the class file under the particular declared package 
otherwise the declared package comes under another folder
For example:- javac -d abc *.javac
In this case the declared package in the particular programs comes under another package named abc
Hence this . operator is very important because the declared package remains a parent file and not a sub file

To get the output of a file in the different package
java PackageName.FileName ---> This is the syntax
